3. Provide a short description of how you approached each problem, issues you 
   encountered, and how you resolved those issues.

   Problem 1 (Using CLEmitter)
      Approach: For problem 1, I basically had the genFactorial file open and
 	read through it and the book to understand how it worked. Once I had a basic
 	understanding of it, it was not too difficult to write the 
	GenIsPrime program

      Issues and resolution: At first I did not have the book and was just 
	trying to go off of online resources for CLEmitter and the GenFactorial 
	program, which made it very difficult. Once I read through appendix D 
	understanding and writing this got a lot easier. 

   Problem 2 (Arithmetic Operations)
      Approach: I read through the provided files, tokeninfo, scanner, 
	parser, JUnary, and Jbinary and got a general idea of what needed
	 to be done. I then read through the book and saw the example in chapter 1
	 for how to do JDivideOp. Once completing that, it was very easy to 
	complete JRemainerOp and JUnaryPlusOp.

      Issues and resolution: I did not have any issues for this one besides 
	having some issues uploading my files at first. Once I figured out 
	why my files were not being accepted, this problem seemed to pass 
	on one of the first tries.

   Problem 3 (Bitwise Operations)
      Approach: This was basically the same as the last problem, but a bit 
	more. I just repeated what I did for the last problem and completed it 
	quickly.

      Issues and resolution: I did not have any issues with problem 3.

   Problem 4 (Shift Operations)
      Approach: I was doing the same as I did for problems 2 and 3, as it 
	was pretty straight forward and similar adding all of these.

      Issues and resolution: I realized during this problem that in Parser
	 I was not adding new expression types and categorizing them 
	properly, and just adding them under the existing categories. 
	I went to the project document and went down to the provided grammar
	 and edited this problem as well as 2 and 3 so Parser was set up 
	correctly. It did technically pass the test on gradescope without 
	doing this, however.

4. Did you receive help from anyone? List their names, status (classmate, 
   CS451/651 grad, TA, other), and the nature of help received.

   Nicholas Pankewytch  Classmate    I generally spoke with him regarding 
	his methodology vs mine when implementing things. He is the one who 
	told me to look at the provided lexical grammar at the bottom on the 
	project handout, which really helped me organize and get my 
	project working. 

5. List any other comments here. Feel free to provide any feedback on how
   much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether you enjoyed
   doing it.

   I felt like I spent the most time on problem 1 due to the fact that I 
	spent two days trying to do it without the book. Once I had the book
	 and completed that problem, it took an hour or two for problem 2 and 
	then problems 3 and 4 followed easily. I enjoyed this homework a bit, 
	although it was not too hard. I felt like I learned a decent amount 
	from this first homework.
